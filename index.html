                Words by The Fellowship<br>
                Reading Time: 8 Minutes<br>
                Location: New York
            </div>
            <p>Let's start with the Oxford definition of the word. It defines a "stan" as "an overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular celebrity." In practice, that's bullshit. What many people pledge themselves under "Stan culture" is, from my unsympathetic perspective, groups of mindless individuals who protect their catalyzed image of whoever or whatever they call themselves stanning.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm not saying all people that stan are parasocial freaks that treat these individuals as besties. But what I am saying is the inclusion and acceptance of these people under the same umbrella you deem yourself bleeds the same actions and intent into these spaces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p><span class="speaker">The Fellowship:</span> How do you approach the Barbs as a case study? It’s a glaring example of cognitive dissonance. Nicki Minaj is married to a registered sex offender. She is a devoted MAGA supporter. She has aligned with homophobic rhetoric.</p>
            <p>If you don't understand why it's logically broken for a demographic to ride hard for someone whose actions work against their existence—then you shouldn't be reading my writing. You should be in a room somewhere being evaluated for basic moral development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p>The Barbs protest for this woman like they personally emerged from her body. They defend the indefensible. They make excuses for the inexcusable. They treat streams and chart positions as more important than actual human rights.</p>
            <p>At a certain point, supporting her stopped being about music and started being about ignoring my own existence as a gay Black male. And that's not something I'm willing to do for anyone's discography.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pull-quote">
            “The group’s values become your values, even when they contradict your own existence. That’s not community. That’s consumption.”
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p>People don't join stan cultures because they're stupid or evil. They join because they're lonely. In 2026, genuine human connection is harder to come by than ever. We don't have third spaces. So we find connection the only way that's available: online.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p>We’ve outsourced identity to content. And when your identity is content, you'll defend the content provider like your life depends on it—because in a way, it does. Without them, who are you?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p>What if we learned how to be fans—real fans, who appreciate the art without worshiping the artist—instead of stans? Right now, we're watching an entire generation trade their humanity for streams. Their self-respect for chart positions.</p>
