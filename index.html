                <h1>Stan culture or submission to the death of individuality?</h1>
                <div class="byline">By The Fellowship · Reading time: 8 minutes</div>

                <p>Let's start with the Oxford definition of the word. It defines a "stan" as "an overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular celebrity." In practice, that's bullshit. What many people pledge themselves under "Stan culture" is, from my unsympathetic perspective, groups of mindless individuals who protect their catalyzed image of whoever or whatever they call themselves stanning.</p>

                <p>Now, I'm not saying all people that stan are parasocial freaks that treat these individuals as besties. But what I <em>am</em> saying is the inclusion and acceptance of these people under the same umbrella you deem yourself bleeds the same actions and intent into these spaces. Harboring this almost primal and toxic defensive environment where, for the lack of a better term, cult-like behaviors emerge. They find any way to protect the ideal and made-up identity for what their celebrity is supposed to be. They don't allow individuals outside—and especially inside these groups—to have any critique or humanity or any kind of ideal on the intent of their existence.</p>

                <p>Translation for the people in the back: <strong>"No, bitch, you cannot think. You're worthless human matter if you don't follow our metrics. We're a hive mind. Submit or get stung."</strong></p>

                <h2>The Barbs: A case study in cognitive dissonance</h2>
                <p>Let's talk about the most glaring example in pop culture right now: the Barbs. I'm not gonna go deep into every detail because even acknowledging this will get me slandered on X by people who've never had an original thought in their lives. But here are facts—not opinions, not hate speech, facts:</p>

                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>Nicki Minaj is married to a registered sex offender.</li>
                    <li>Nicki Minaj is now a devoted MAGA supporter and Trump super stan.</li>
                    <li>Nicki Minaj has publicly aligned with homophobic rhetoric and figures.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Now, let's use logic for a second—not politics, not morality, just straight logic. Nicki Minaj is a Black woman. She's an immigrant. She has a minor child. Her primary fanbase? Black gay males. Gay males in general. If you don't see the problem here—if you don't understand why it's <em>logically broken</em> for a demographic to ride hard for someone whose actions and alliances actively work against their existence—then you shouldn't be reading my writing. You should be in a room somewhere being evaluated for basic moral and perceptual development. Because it's not complicated.</p>

                <div class="pull-quote">
                    “The same people who defend this will do it for way less. That’s the problem with Stan culture.”
                    <cite>— The Fellowship</cite>
                </div>

                <p>And yet. The Barbs <em>protest</em> for this woman like they personally emerged from her body. They defend the indefensible. They make excuses for the inexcusable. They treat streams and chart positions as more important than <em>actual human rights</em>. I'm not saying I never fucked with Nicki. I did. But at a certain point, supporting her stopped being about music and started being about ignoring my own existence as a gay Black male. And that's not something I'm willing to do for anyone's discography.</p>

                <h2>The web: how Stan culture connects to everything</h2>
                <p>Because here's what people don't want to see—this isn't an isolated phenomenon. This is a web. The same dynamics that make a Barb defend a homophobic MAGA supporter are the same dynamics that make people stay in toxic relationships, vote against their own interests, or lose themselves in online echo chambers. Stan culture is just the most visible, most unserious version of a disease that's infected everything: <strong>the inability to hold a self outside of the things you consume.</strong></p>

                <p>We are raising—have raised—generations of people who don't know how to be a person outside of who they stan, what music they listen to, who they follow, what they post, what algorithm they're trapped in. We've outsourced identity to content. And when your identity is content, you'll defend the content provider like your life depends on it—because in a way, it does. Without them, who are you?</p>

                <h2>The real human need nobody wants to admit</h2>
                <p>People don't join stan cultures because they're stupid or evil. They join because they're <em>lonely</em>. In 2026, genuine human connection is harder to come by than ever. We don't know our neighbors. We don't have third spaces. So we find connection the only way that's available: online, in communities built around shared consumption. The problem isn't the desire for connection. That's human. The problem is that these communities, as currently structured, demand a price for entry: <strong>your individuality.</strong></p>

                <p>You can't just like the music. You have to defend the person. You can't just enjoy the content. You have to attack the critics. You can't just be a fan. You have to be a <em>stan</em>. And slowly, the lines blur. The group's values become your values, even when they contradict your own existence. That's not community. That's consumption disguised as connection.</p>

                <h2>So what do we do?</h2>
                <p>I'm not naive enough to think I can rewrite society with one magazine piece. I'm not arrogant enough to think I have all the answers. But here's what I <em>am</em> asking: What if we tried something else? What if we built connection that didn't require self-destruction? What if we learned how to be fans—real fans, who appreciate the art without worshiping the artist—instead of stans?</p>

                <p>Because right now, we're watching an entire generation trade their humanity for streams. Their self-respect for chart positions. Their individuality for the temporary warmth of a hive mind. And that's not fandom. That's submission. That's the death of individuality dressed up in fan cams and hashtags. And I, for one, am not here for it.</p>
